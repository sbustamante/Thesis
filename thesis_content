	1.3.3. Planck



2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK					( 15 PAGES )

4. RESULTS (?)							( 10 PAGES )
-----------
Here is shown all the results about the environment influence on LG systems 
in the cosmological simulations used (Bolshoi and CLUES), besides a 
characterization of these simulations, including analysis about the environment
distributions and a comparison among them.

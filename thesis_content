1. INTRODUCTION							( 5 PAGES )
---------------
A brief historical introduction to cosmology and large-scale astrophysics, 
Passing from ancient astronomy, scientific revolution (Copernicus, Galileo, 
Newton) until Einsten's general relavitivy and the current state of cosmology.

    1.3  Cosmological Observations


2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK					( 15 PAGES )

4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS (?)					( 15 PAGES )
-----------
Here is shown all the results about the environment influence on LG systems 
in the cosmological simulations used (Bolshoi and CLUES), besides a 
characterization of these simulations, including analysis about the environment
distributions and a comparison among them.

    4.1. Statistical properties of all simulations
	4.1.1. Environment distributions
	4.1.2. Halos distributions

    4.2. Properties of sample pairs
	4.2.1. Statistical properties of pairs
	4.2.2. Angular momentum and energy
	4.2.3. Determination of their host environment

    4.3. Correlations between the environment and pairs properties

    4.4. Orientation of pairs angular momentum (?)

INTRODUCTION
------------
*	Herschel's model of our galaxy.
*	Different geometries with variation of fifth Euclides postulate.
*	


THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
---------------------
*	Metric of a 2D sphere


N-BODY SIMULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZATION
---------------------------------------------------



RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
-----------------------
*	Plot of each simulation. (Illustrative purposes)
	Density diagram with haloes sample (BDM or FOF)						| |
*	Histogram of the three eigenvalues (Vweb, Tweb?) for each simulation.			| |
*	Histogram of each simulation respec to the Lambda_th value (volume)			| |
*	Plot of each CLUES LG pairs showed on density map					| |
*	Environment of each CLUES LG pairs respect to the Lambda_th				| |
*	Correlation bewteen the density field and Lambda_eigenvalues, all this			| |
	with the aim of determining an optim value of lambda_th

*	Halos mass and Isolated pairs histogram. (Indicating the three 
	CLUES LG)										| |
*	Energy, angular momentum, separation and velocities distributions of
	each sample										| |
*	Distribution of embedded environments of each Isolated pairs, respec to
	lambda_th value.									| |
*	Density diagrams (Number of pairs respec to the volume of each			
	environment type) to determinate the most favorable environment to 
	imbibbe Isolated Pairs systems								| |

*	Lambda cuts respect to CLUES LG systems.						| |
*	Distribution of eigenvalues associated to LG system (Bolshoi)				| |

*	Orientation of angular momentum of pairs respect to the main directions
	of eigenvectors.									| |
